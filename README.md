# CO2-System-Extd

Software to calculate marine CO2 system variables and propagate uncertainties, unique in the ability to input diccolved carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ion, and carbonate ion concnetrations along with the anoxic constituents ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. CO2Sys was inititally developed by Lewis and Wallace (1998) for MS DOS, later adapted for MS Excel and MATLAB by Pierrot (2006). The code was vectorized, refined, and optimized for computational speed by van Heuven (2011). Options for error propagation were added recently by Orr et al. (2018). This software builds upon previous versions and differs in its ability to handle CO2, HCO3, CO3, NH4, and H2S along with their associated uncertainties as input parameters.

## Citation

If using the CO2SYS.m MATLAB program for CO2 system calculations, cite the original CO2SYS DOS work of Lewis and Wallace (1998) and the MATLAB program of van Heuven et al. (2011). If using the derivnum.m and errors.m programs for CO2 system error propagations, cite also the work of Orr et al. (2018). If using CO2SYS_extd.m, cite also this repository (Sharp, 2019).
